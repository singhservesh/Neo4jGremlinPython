# Neo4jGremlinPython
Neo4j Docker for Gremlin with python clients

This is Docker image for Neo4j Graph running under Gremlin Server. 



## Getting Started

Follow the steps and prerequisites to start the Neo4j graph server with python based gremlin client. 
Use examples to write gremlin queries using gremlin-python drivers.

### Prerequisites
Please make sure that :
```
1) docker is installed.
2) gremlin-python 3.3.4 is installed.
3) Python is installed.
4) GNU Make( optional ).
5) JRE is installed.

```

--Usage--

To create a docker image use:
```
make 
```

to run docker image use:
```
make run
```

to run docker image in attached mode use:
```
make attach
```

to delete an existing image use:
```
make delete
```

to run test script/example use:
```
make test
```

To list all the images and containers use:
```
make show
```

If GNU Make utility is not installed then docker image can be created by running build.sh script:
```
./build.sh
```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Clone source code using HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/singhservesh/JanusGraphServerDocker.git
OR using SSH:
git clone git@github.com:singhservesh/JanusGraphServerDocker.git

```

And repeat

```
cd JanusGraphServerDocker/
```

Try below commands one by one.
```
make
make run
```

## Running the tests

```
make test

    graphtraversalsource[graph[empty]]
    Add one more passenger named Zane
    Add one  more airports
    Total vertex i.e. airports and passengers
    4
    Total passenger count
    2
    All passengers
    [vp[name->River], vp[name->Zane]]
    Total airport count

    2
    All airports
    [vp[name->IVE], vp[country->IND], vp[name->ANE], vp[country->IND]]
```


### Break down into end to end tests

make test will run test-gremlin-python.py script and add vertices and then it will print it.

```
make test 
or 
python examples/test-gremlin-python.py
```

### And coding style tests
